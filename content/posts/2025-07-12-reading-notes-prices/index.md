《无价：洞悉大众心理玩转价格游戏》 from William Poundstone

# Notes

## 1

- 任意连贯性：该理论说，消费者其实并不知道什么东西该值多少钱。他们茫然地穿过超市货架，根据种种线索判断价格。任意连贯性首先是一种相对理论。买家的主要敏感点是**相对差异**，而非绝对价格。

- 在估计未知数量时，**最初的一个数值（​“锚点”​）充当了心理上的标杆或起点**。

- Boomerang effect does not exist, A higher anchor always brings higher expectation, just not as effective.

- Jurors are poor at scaling dollar amounts to the size of a crime or problem.

## 2

- Weber carefully added tiny weights until the subject said his burden felt noticeably heavier (a “just noticeable difference”). He determined that it was the relative (percentage) change in weight that mattered—not the absolute change in grams or pounds.

- Careful experiments have shown that point sources of light have to be about four times brighter, physically, to look twice as bright, subjectively.

- Equal stimulus ratios produce equal subjective ratios.

- The price of being so acutely sensitive to ratios and contrasts is a relative insensitivity to the absolute.

- Have you ever taken a sip of tea, expecting it to be coffee? For a fleeting moment, the taste is indescribably alien. It doesn’t taste like tea, or like coffee. You’re tasting the gap between what you expected and what you got.

- When estimating monetary values, people are easily swayed by the legerdemain of anchoring, by illusions trading on contrasts and the power of suggestion.

## 3

- people are not especially good at making decisions under uncertainty.

- There is often a huge subjective difference between an absolute, 100 percent sure thing and something that is only 99 percent likely. This difference is expressed in prices as well as choices. Meanwhile, the difference between a 10 and an 11 percent chance is shrugged off.

- the *endowment effect*. In the absence of market values, selling prices are typically twice as much as buying prices

- When asked to price bets, players direct their attention to the prize amounts. The most likely or biggest prize amount becomes a starting point or anchor. The players knew they had to adjust from the anchor to take into account the probabilities and any other prizes or penalties.

- decision makers give the most attention to information that is most compatible with the required answer.

- *Preference reversal*: Consider the following bet pair:
    - Bet A: 80% +5, 20% +0
    - Bet B: 10% +40, 90% +0
    
    People are more likely to choose Bet A, while assign a higher price for Bet B.

- *Three umpires*:
    1. Values exist, people perceive and report them as best they can, possibly with bias.
    2. People know their values and preferences directly.
    3. Values are commonly constructed in the process of elicitation.
